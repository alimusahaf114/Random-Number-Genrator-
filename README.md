## Random Number Generator

A simple JavaScript project that generates random numbers within a specified range.

### Features
- Generates random integers between a minimum and maximum value, inclusive.
- Uses JavaScript's `Math.random()` and `Math.floor()` functions to achieve randomness and integer generation.
- User can specify the range by setting the `minNum` and `maxNum` values.

### Usage
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/random-number-generator.git
    ```
2. Open the `index.html` file in your browser.
3. Modify the `minNum` and `maxNum` values in the JavaScript code to set your desired range.
4. Open the console in your browser's developer tools to see the generated random number.

### Example Code
```javascript
const minNum = 50;
const maxNum = 100;
const answer = Math.floor(Math.random() * (maxNum - minNum + 1) + minNum);
console.log(answer);
```

### How It Works
1. **Initialize Range**: Define the minimum (`minNum`) and maximum (`maxNum`) values for the random number generation.
2. **Generate Random Number**: Use `Math.random()` to generate a random floating-point number between 0 (inclusive) and 1 (exclusive).
3. **Scale to Range**: Multiply the random number by the size of the range (`maxNum - minNum + 1`).
4. **Shift to Start from Minimum**: Add `minNum` to the scaled random number to shift the range to start at `minNum`.
5. **Floor the Value**: Use `Math.floor()` to round down to the nearest integer, ensuring the result is an integer within the specified range.
